RELEASE NOTES BIG DEAL

Version 1.2, September 8, 2012

The program was recompiled for a Windows instead of a DOS environment. It is still a command line application.
It runs on old and new machines, on 32-bit and 64-bit OSes.

No visible changes were made to the program. It is fine as it is...

===================================================================================================

Version 1.1, September 8, 2000

Visible changes from version 1.0

- During the init dialog an empty answer was misinterpreted. Fixed.
- The format of the .INI file generated was changed, to aid Windows frontends.
- The bigdealx program did not terminate a string properly. Fixed.
  This means that the 1.1 version will complain about the contents of the dealentr.txt from 1.0
- and formats!!

Changed formats in 1.1

- The PBN format now has no Event tag, but a Generator tag
- The DUP format acquired a "header" after hand 1. This is more like the Jannersten version
- There is now also a DUPBLIND format, which does not show the hands on screen
- The internal GOEDEL format(only in bigdealx) now prints out the 29 digit decimal number

New formats in 1.1

- The DLM and DLMBLIND formats, for Jannersten Windup. Late addition, had limited testing.
  But Windup accepts the files, which was good enough for this release.
- The CSV format, for database imports, or wordprocessor macros.

No changes were made to the dealing guts of the program.
